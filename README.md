# Catppuccin like theme for Markdown Viewer
## Description
This is a theme that automatically switches between Latte and Moca themes by following browser's theme. This theme has been made for Markdown Viewer because of the lack of good themes that follow systheme's theme to me.  

## Credits
This is a theme for [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer), made by myself and with Chat GPT4-o (on [duckduckgo](https://duck.ai)) for very very base.

## Color scheme
Color theme: Catppuccin's palette (latte and mocha)  
Accent color: mauve (well, only links actually use it but it's here)  

## Notes 
- Some `!important` tags are required at few spots and I don't know why, help is welcome  
- It may be incomplete because of my basic usage of it.
- Adding variables would make it better for further edition
- Sorry for my poor frenchy english
